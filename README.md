# WP_Hide-tags
Short WordPress plugin that hides tags from anon visitors

this was done for internal use, when I moved from Finnish site curated articles to English sister site. I used AI to translate every articles that were tagged as `translate` anf after process a script changed tag to `translated`.

I used this simple plugin to hide those two tags from random visitors, but is shows them to logged in ones. I didn't bother to star tune up is to use roles.

So if you use this you must change tags, or add new ones, directy in the php. if you want to do it the most easiest way you install the plugin and thwn jump to shell and edit using nano, vim or what ever is your choose.
